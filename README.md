`Iâ€™m a bot! You send me a location via SMS, and I reply with the nearest location I know of for the thing I know how to locate.`

## Running `sms-location-bot`

`sms-location-bot` is an Express app that can be run via e.g. `node index.js`, but see configuration documentation below.
It has a `POST` endpoint at `/sms` and is designed to be used as a Twilio [webhook](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/node).
It _also_ expects to be run in some kind of host that handles SSL termination on its behalf and so uses HTTP.
